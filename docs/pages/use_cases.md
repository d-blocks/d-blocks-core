# Supported Use Cases

ðŸš€ *Note: Several features required for the following use cases are still in progress and will be added soon as per the Road Map.*

d-bee provides powerful database management and deployment capabilities tailored for various scenarios. Below is a collection of **use cases** demonstrating how d-bee supports development, deployment, and maintenance of database environments efficiently.

---

## **Development Support**

### **1. Extracting Database Code for Version Control**
- Extract existing database objects from a **production system** and initialize the **master branch** in Git.
- Capture changes from a **specific developer** and commit only modified objects.
- Synchronize environments incrementally by extracting objects modified in a specific time range (e.g., last 24 hours).

### **2. Deploying Code to Development Environments**
- Deploy database changes directly from Git or a specified path.
- Automatically handle **conflicts** using customizable strategies (`rename`, `drop`, or `raise error`).
- Developers no longer need to manually resolve standard deployment issues.

### **3. Synchronizing Development Environments with Git**
- Refresh a development environment to match the latest changes from a **Git branch** before starting a new feature.
- Ensure smooth onboarding for developers by providing a **fully synchronized environment**.

---

## **Testing and CI/CD Integration**

### **4. Supporting Continuous Integration (CI) in Testing Environments**
- Automate daily **full builds** in a testing environment.
- Ensure integration of features from **multiple development teams** before deployment to production.
- Keep the testing environment **synchronized** with a shared integration branch.

### **5. Quick Synchronization of Testing and Production Environments**
- Compare **testing and production environments**.
- Generate a **gap package** using the **Package Creation** feature.
- Deploy the generated package to align the environments efficiently.

---

## **Production Deployment**

### **6. Incremental Package Deployment**
- Automatically generate an **incremental package** by comparing a **Git branch with its original state**.
- Deploy the package first to **testing** and then to **production**, ensuring a controlled rollout.
- Maintain a **high level of failure resistance and recovery options**.

### **7. Controlled Deployment of Changes Using BTEQ Directives**
- Incorporate **BTEQ scripting** to apply best practices for **stable package deployments**.
- Automate deployment processes with **custom logic** to handle edge cases and transactional safety.

### **8. Advanced Conflict Management During Package Deployment**
- Define **conflict resolution strategies** per:
  - **Deployment process**
  - **Step level**
  - **Database level**
  - **Individual file level**
- Ensure precise control over how changes are introduced to production.

---

## **Database Maintenance & Environment Management**

### **9. Provisioning a New Development or Testing Environment**
- Set up a **new environment from scratch**.
- Deploy all required objects using **environment deployment**.
- Ensure complete consistency with other existing environments.

### **10. Cloning an Existing Environment**
- Extract objects from one environment and deploy them into another.
- Common use case: **aligning a testing environment with production before releasing new changes**.

### **11. Automated Cleanup of Backup Objects**
- Identify and remove **old, unused backup objects**.
- Keep environments **organized and efficient**.

---

## **Advanced Comparison and Validation**

### **12. Comparing Environments and Generating Update Packages**
- Compare:
  - **Two database environments** (e.g., Dev vs. Test, Test vs. Prod).
  - **An environment vs. a Git branch**.
  - **Two Git branches** (e.g., `release` vs `master`).
- Generate **reports** visualizing differences and create an **incremental package** to align environments.

### **13. Validating dbt Models Against Database Schema**
- Ensure **dbt models and database structures** remain in sync.
- Auto-generate **dbt models** from a given physical schema.
- Define validation rules to catch **schema drift issues early**.

### **14. Suggesting Index and Statistics for Performance Optimization**
- Identify missing or inefficient **indexes and statistics**.
- Provide optimization recommendations based on database workload analysis.

---

## **Long-Term Vision**

### **15. Integrating d-bee with Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**
- Enable **d-bee commands** directly in VS Code.
- Provide **database model visualization** and support for **data modelers**.
- Allow Python-based **automation for large-scale database modeling**.

---

With **d-bee**, users can seamlessly manage database development, deployment, and versioning, ensuring **efficient workflows** across all environments. ðŸš€
