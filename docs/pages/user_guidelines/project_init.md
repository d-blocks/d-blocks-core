# Feature: Project Initialization

## Overview
Project initialization is the first and most crucial step when deciding to maintain database code in Git. Whether you are working with existing database environments or starting a new implementation, **initializing a project** ensures a structured setup.

Debbie supports this process with a simple command:
```bash
dbee init
```
This command sets up a **Debbie project** by initializing a Git repository (if not already done) and creating essential configuration files.

## Steps for Project Initialization

### **1. Running `dbee init`**
To initialize a Debbie project, navigate to the **root folder** where you want to store the Git repository and run:
```bash
dbee init
```

### **2. Choosing Configuration File Location**
After running the command, you will be asked whether the **default configuration files** should be:
- Stored **in the current directory** (to be version-controlled in Git).
- Created **in your home directory** (stored privately and outside version control).

ðŸ”¹ If stored in the Git repository, configuration files will be shared among users working on the project.  
ðŸ”¹ If stored in the home directory, they remain private to the local user.  

*Note:* Users can later move the configuration files between locations if needed. More details can be found in [Configuration Guide](configuration.md).

### **3. Initializing the Git Repository (Optional)**
If the directory is not already a Git repository, Debbie will prompt you to initialize it. This includes:
- Running `git init`
- Configuring Git settings
- Creating a `.gitignore` file with recommended default settings

### **4. Reviewing and Modifying Configuration**
Once initialization is complete, review the generated configuration files:
- **`dblocks.toml`** (public configuration, stored in Git if selected)
- **`.dblocks-secrets.toml`** (private configuration, stored securely in the home directory)

Modify them according to project needs by following the [Configuration Guide](configuration.md).

## Next Steps
After initializing the project:
- Adjust the configuration for your environments.
- Use `dbee export` to synchronize existing database objects to Git.
- Begin working with Debbieâ€™s features to manage database code efficiently.

By following this structured setup, you ensure **best practices** and **smooth integration** of database code management within Git. ðŸš€
