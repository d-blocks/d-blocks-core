## Management Summary

This feature introduces several quality-of-life improvements for working with Teradata in Python, particularly in Jupyter notebooks. The key challenges addressed include:

1. **Verbose Connection Definitions**: Simplifies the process of defining Teradata connections by reducing the need to remember parameter names.
2. **Error Handling Improvements**: Enhances error messages to make them more readable and to immediately display the critical error information instead of burying it in long stack traces.
3. **SQLAlchemy Support**: Provides an easier way to establish connections using SQLAlchemy, avoiding the need to remember complex connection string formats.
4. **Checkpointing for Long Scripts**: Introduces a checkpoint mechanism to avoid redundant execution of SQL statements, saving processing time and effort when scripts fail midway.

These improvements significantly enhance the user experience when using Teradata in Jupyter notebooks.

## Feature: Quality of Life Improvements for Jupyter

### Overview

Whenever I work with Teradata in a Python script or a Jupyter notebook, I lack a simple mechanism to connect to a specified environment using a given user.

The process isn’t complicated—it just requires importing a few libraries and writing a few lines of code:

```python
import teradatasql as td

# Get the connection
CONNECT_PARAMS = {
    "host": "__hostname__",
    "user": "__my_username__",
    "password": "__my_password__",
    "logmech": "LDAP",
    "tmode": "TERA",
}

with td.connect(**CONNECT_PARAMS) as con:
    with con.cursor() as cur:
        data = [r for r in cur.execute("select 1/0 as id_ ")]
        columns = [d[0] for d in cur.description]
        records = [dict(zip(columns, row)) for row in data]
```

However, there are a few problems with this approach:

### Verbosity of Connection Definition

I work with Teradata **a lot**, but I spend most of my time in SQL clients like DBeaver. Unfortunately, I don’t always remember the parameter names for the connection definition and have to look them up in the documentation every time.

### Error Handling: Hard to Identify the Problem Quickly

When an error occurs, Jupyter displays a long and verbose traceback. For example, the above snippet is invalid, but Jupyter spits out the stack trace.


- The error message is buried in a long, **long** stack trace.
- Jupyter hides the most important part: the actual error reported by the database.
- There is no indication of which query caused the error.

### SQLAlchemy Support

I prefer using SQLAlchemy, but if I don’t always remember the `teradatasql` connection parameters, forming a valid SQLAlchemy connection string is even harder. I need a simple way to initialize a connection without remembering every detail.

### A Better Approach

Now, I can write something like this:

```python
import dblocks_core as dbe
import sqlalchemy as sa

engine = dbe.init("prod").engine
with engine.connect() as con, dbe.tera_catch():  
    sql = sa.text("select 1/0")
    rslt = [r for r in con.execute(sql)]
```

Now, Jupyter provides a clean error message directly below the failed cell:

```
13:16:37 | ERROR    | tera_catch - ERROR: 2618: Invalid calculation: division by zero.
statement = select 1/0 ...
```

The full stack trace is still available but doesn’t clutter the main output.

### Checkpoints: Prevent Redundant Execution

When running a script that modifies the Teradata environment, errors can cause the script to fail partway. Instead of rerunning everything, I can use checkpoints to resume execution from where it left off:

```python
import sqlalchemy as sa
import dblocks_core as dbe

statements = [
    "select 1;",   # This is OK
    "select 1/0;", # This will FAIL
    "select 2;",   # This is OK
]

ctx = dbe.JupyterContext("a-long-operation")
with engine.connect() as con, dbe.tera_catch():  
    for sql in statements:
        if ctx.get_checkpoint(sql):
            logger.warning(f"Skipping: {sql}")
            continue
        logger.info(f"Executing: {sql}")
        stmt = sa.text(sql)
        con.execute(stmt)
        ctx.set_checkpoint(sql)  # Do not execute it twice
    ctx.done()
```

**Example Log Output:**

```
13:58:39 | INFO     | <module> - executing: select 1;
13:58:39 | INFO     | <module> - executing: select 1/0;
13:58:39 | ERROR    | tera_catch - ERROR: 2618: Invalid calculation: division by zero.
statement = select 1/0; ...
```

When rerun, the first statement is skipped due to the checkpoint:

```
14:02:07 | WARNING  | <module> - skipping: select 1;
14:02:07 | INFO     | <module> - executing: select 1/0;
14:02:07 | ERROR    | tera_catch - ERROR: 2618: Invalid calculation: division by zero.
statement = select 1/0; ...
```

### Finishing the Context

If I don’t mark the context as done, the checkpoint file (a simple JSON) remains, causing all previously executed statements to be skipped. To finalize and remove checkpoints, I use:

```python
ctx.done()
```

That's it. Happy coding!
