# d-blocks: Bringing Teradata Code Under Control

## Overview

**d-blocks** is a powerful open-source utility designed to bring **Teradata database code** under **Git-based version control** while seamlessly integrating with modern **CI/CD processes**. With d-blocks, organizations of all sizes--**from large enterprises to smaller teams**--can standardize and automate their daily database code workflows.

### Why d-blocks?

üöÄ **Gain full control over your Teradata DDLs** by leveraging Git as the single source of truth.<br>
üîÑ **Synchronize** Git branches with Teradata environments (**DEV, TEST, PROD**).<br>
üì¶ **Deploy safely** from Git to database environments with various deployment strategies, including **incremental changes and rollback options**.<br>
‚öñÔ∏è **Compare environments and Git versions** to track changes and resolve discrepancies efficiently.<br>
ü§ñ **Automate package creation and deployments**, making release management easier.<br>
üåç **Leverage best practices and lessons learned** from **global teams** to improve your database development workflows.

d-blocks is not just a tool--it's a **community-driven initiative** that continuously evolves to incorporate the best strategies for database source control and release management.

## Quick Start

### **1\. Prerequisites**

Before installing d-blocks, ensure you have the following:

- **Python 3.8+** installed ([Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
- **Git client** installed ([Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads))
- **Access to a Teradata database** (e.g., local, cloud, or enterprise)

### **2\. Installation**

Install d-blocks using pip:

```bash
pip install dblocks
```

### **3\. Basic Usage**

Initialize a new d-blocks project:

```bash
dblocks init
```

Synchronize Git with your Teradata environment:

```bash
dblocks sync --source git --target teradata
```

Deploy database changes from Git to your environment:

```bash
dblocks deploy --strategy incremental
```

## Typical Use Cases

d-blocks helps projects solve common database source control and deployment challenges, including:

- **Version-controlling Teradata code** and integrating it into existing Git workflows.
- **Managing multiple environments (DEV, TEST, PROD)** and ensuring consistency.
- **Deploying incremental changes** while minimizing risks.
- **Comparing database states** across environments and branches.
- **Automating routine database deployment processes** with CI/CD pipelines.
